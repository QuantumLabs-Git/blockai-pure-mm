# Settings Page Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive settings page with blockchain API configuration options for all supported blockchains, along with a gear icon in the top right corner of every page that links to this settings page.

## Key Features

### 1. Blockchain API Settings
- **Per-Blockchain Configuration**: Separate tabs for Ethereum, BSC, Base, Solana, and SUI
- **API Endpoints**: Input fields for RPC URLs and WebSocket URLs for each blockchain
- **API Keys**: Secure password fields for storing API keys
- **Block Explorers**: Customizable block explorer URLs

### 2. Application Settings
- **Theme Selection**: Options for dark mode, light mode, or system preference
- **Gas Price Settings**: Configurable gas price multiplier for transactions
- **Transaction Confirmations**: Adjustable number of confirmations required

### 3. Security Settings
- **Auto-Lock**: Configurable timeout for automatically locking wallet access
- **Wallet Memory**: Option to remember selected wallets between sessions
- **Encrypted Storage**: Option to store encrypted private keys locally with password protection

## Implementation Details

### 1. Files Created/Modified
- **settings.html**: New template for the settings page
- **base.html**: Updated to include the settings gear icon in the navbar
- **app.py**: Added a new route for the settings page
- **style.css**: Added styles for the settings page and gear icon
- **directory-structure.txt**: Updated to include the new settings.html file

### 2. UI/UX Design
- **Tabbed Interface**: Easy navigation between different blockchain settings
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages when saving settings
- **Reset Options**: Ability to reset sections to default values

### 3. Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: All settings are stored in the browser's localStorage
- **Security**: Private information is stored securely, with encryption for sensitive data
- **Persistence**: Settings persist between sessions
- **No Server Storage**: All settings remain client-side for privacy and security

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Navigation
- Added a gear icon to the top right corner of the navigation bar
- The icon links to the `/settings` route
- The icon has a hover effect (rotation) for visual feedback

### 2. Settings Storage
- All settings are stored in localStorage using intuitive key names
- Settings are loaded when the page loads
- Changes are saved immediately when the user submits a form

### 3. Form Validation
- Input validation ensures valid values for numeric fields
- Password field is required when selecting to store encrypted keys
- Error messages guide users when providing invalid input

### 4. Blockchain-Specific Styling
- Each blockchain tab has its own color scheme matching the blockchain's branding
- Active tab is highlighted with the corresponding blockchain color
- Visual consistency with the rest of the application

## User Experience

1. User navigates to any page in the application
2. User notices the settings gear icon in the top right corner
3. User clicks the icon and is taken to the settings page
4. User can configure blockchain API settings by selecting the appropriate tab
5. User can adjust application and security settings
6. Settings are saved locally and persist between sessions
7. User can reset to defaults if needed

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in the browser's localStorage, which has security limitations
- An encryption password option is provided for storing private keys
- Auto-lock feature adds an additional layer of security
- All settings remain client-side and are never sent to a server

## Future Enhancements

- Add option to export/import settings
- Implement end-to-end encryption for more sensitive data
- Add API connection testing functionality
- Support for more blockchains as they are added to the application
- Add confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
- Implement custom themes beyond just dark/light options
