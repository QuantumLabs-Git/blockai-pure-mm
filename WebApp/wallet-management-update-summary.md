# Wallet Management Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Frontend - WalletManagement.jsx**
- Imported and integrated `useProject` hook from ProjectContext
- Added state management for project wallets and wallet association
- Added functions to add/remove wallets from projects
- Updated the UI to show:
  - Current project name and warning if no project is selected
  - Which wallets are associated with the current project
  - Buttons to add/remove wallets from projects (with permission checks)
  - A list of project-associated wallets at the bottom of the manage tab

### 2. **Backend - Project Model**
- Updated the `wallets` field structure from an array of objects to chain-specific arrays:
  ```javascript
  wallets: {
    ethereum: [String],
    solana: [String],
    bsc: [String],
    base: [String],
    sui: [String]
  }
  ```

### 3. **Backend - Project Routes**
- Added 'wallets' to the allowed update fields in the PATCH endpoint
- This allows the frontend to update wallet associations

### 4. **ProjectContext API URLs**
- Updated all API endpoints to use full URLs (http://localhost:5001/api/...)
- This ensures proper communication between frontend and backend

## Features Implemented

1. **Project Association**: Wallets can now be associated with specific projects
2. **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges showing which wallets belong to the current project
3. **Permission Checks**: Only users with 'member' permissions or higher can add/remove wallets
4. **Project Status**: Shows current project name or warning if no project is selected
5. **Chain-Specific Storage**: Wallets are stored per blockchain type within each project

## Usage

1. Select or create a project first
2. Import or generate wallets as usual
3. Click the green "+" button to add a wallet to the current project
4. Click the yellow "-" button to remove a wallet from the project
5. Project-associated wallets are shown with a "In Project" badge
6. A list of all project wallets for the current chain is shown at the bottom

## Next Steps

Consider implementing:
- Bulk wallet import to project
- Wallet labels/names within projects
- Export project-specific wallet lists
- Wallet activity tracking per project
