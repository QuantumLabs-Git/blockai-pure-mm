# BSC Wallet Generator Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a BSC wallet generator tool that appears under the Wallet Management page when the user selects BSC from the blockchain dropdown. This tool allows users to:

1. Specify how many wallets to generate (1-1000)
2. Choose a custom filename for the generated Excel file
3. Download the generated wallets with their addresses and private keys

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `wallet_management.html`
- Added a new card section for the BSC wallet generator that is hidden by default
- Created a form to input the number of wallets and filename
- Added JavaScript to show/hide the generator based on blockchain selection
- Implemented AJAX form submission to prevent page reloads

### 2. Updated `app.py`
- Added a new route `/generate_wallets` to handle wallet generation
- Implemented the wallet generation logic from `fixed-code.py`
- Created a `/downloads/<filename>` route to serve generated files
- Added a downloads folder in the static directory

### 3. Created/Updated CSS (`style.css`)
- Added styles for the BlockAI accent colors
- Improved form elements and card styling
- Added styles for the blockchain selector

### 4. Enhanced JavaScript (`main.js`)
- Added functionality to remember the selected blockchain across page navigation
- Implemented utility functions for formatting addresses and numbers
- Added a toast notification system for feedback
- Created clipboard copy functionality

## How It Works

1. When a user selects "BSC" from the blockchain dropdown in the top right corner, JavaScript code detects this change and shows the wallet generator tool.
2. The user can specify how many wallets to create (1-1000) and set a custom filename.
3. When the user clicks "Generate Wallets", JavaScript sends an AJAX request to the server.
4. The server generates the requested number of wallets using Web3.py, saves them to an Excel file, and returns a download link.
5. The user can download the file, which contains wallet addresses and private keys.

## Security Considerations

- Files are generated with a timestamp prefix to prevent overwrites
- Private keys are validated to ensure they're in the correct format
- The user can only generate up to 1000 wallets at once to prevent excessive resource usage
- Files are stored in a downloads directory that's separate from application code

## User Experience Improvements

- The blockchain selector remembers the user's choice across page navigation
- The wallet generator appears instantly when BSC is selected without requiring a page reload
- The form submission happens via AJAX to provide a seamless experience
- Clear feedback is provided when wallets are generated

## Files Modified

1. `/templates/wallet_management.html` - Added the wallet generator UI
2. `/app.py` - Added routes for wallet generation and file downloads
3. `/static/css/style.css` - Added styling for the new components
4. `/static/js/main.js` - Added JavaScript functionality for blockchain selection and UI interactions

## Future Enhancements

- Add password protection option for the generated Excel file
- Implement batch naming for generated wallets
- Add options to export in different formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Provide a preview of a few generated wallets before download
- Add custom wallet derivation paths
